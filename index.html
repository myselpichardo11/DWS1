		<h2 id="History">The Piano: It's Early History </h2>

			<p>The first true piano was invented almost entirely by one
			man, a modest harpischord maker named <strong>Bartolomeo di
			Francesco Cristofori</strong>. He was a intelligent man who
			created many stringed instruments such as the spinet,
			virginal, clavecin, gravicembalo, and finally, the
			harpsichord.</p>

			<p>First exhibited in Florence in 1709, the new instrument
			was named gravicembalo col piano e forte <strong>(roughly
			“soft and loud keyboard instrument”)</strong>. Eventually,
			it was shortened to fortepiano and then finally just the
			"piano".</p>

			<p>The touching sounds of the piano chords emerged make it one 
			of the most popularly played instruments today. A highly versatile 
			instrument capable of playing almost anything an orchestra can play!</p>

		<h2 id="Kind">Is there only one kind of Piano?</h2>
			<p>Although Bartolomeo di Francesco Cristofori set the roots for the importance of the piano today,
			many inventors took the idea and added different aspects to the way they were built!</p>
			
		<h3 id="Types">Piano Types</h3>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>The Viennese Piano</strong></li>
					
						<li>The sound made by a Viennese piano of this type is much lighter and
						 more delicate than that of a modern instrument. The great Viennese 
						 composers, Mozart, Beethoven, Haydn and others, would have played the 
						 Viennese piano</li>
					
				<li><strong>The English Piano</strong></li>
					<li>Rococo instruments such as this are adorned with shell-like flourishes. 
						The style was prominent in Europe during the 18th century and was revived in
						the middle of the 19th.</li>
					
				<li><strong>The Modern Piano</strong></li>
					
						<li>The first D-style grand piano was made in about 1857, but it took a further
						 ten years for Steinway to develop its unique rim-bending process. </li>
					
				<li><strong>The Square Piano</strong></li>
					
						<li>In the concert hall, the square piano had one advantage over the grand piano:
						 the direct line of view from the audience to the pianist and that it is smaller in size.</li>
					
				<li><strong>The "Art-Case" Piano</strong></li>
					
						<li>Known as a 'Centennial Grand', it was built in 1876, 100 years after the American 
						Declaration of Independence.</li>
					
				<li><strong>The Avant-Garde Piano</strong></li>
					
						<li>This piano employs a modern style based on strong color and extensive use of brass</li>
					
				<li><strong>The Grand Piano</strong></li>
					
						<li>The most widely used piano today! Grand pianos have become the 
						benchmark for well-crafted pianos!</li>
					
			</ul>
			
			<p>Every class of piano is different and many play different ranges, but essentially the beautiful
			music they all produce is one in the same.</p>
